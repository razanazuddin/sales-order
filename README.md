# Sales Order page

The purpose of this tiny project is to display a list of sales order and to filter the list. This project is coded from scratch in React.js with Express.js as the back-end framework and using TailwindCSS library for styling.

I have spent about:
- 1.5 hours setting up app
- 1 hour adding sample data and setting simple API endpoint
- 0.5 hour adding sales order table and integrate with endpoint
- 1 hour adding filter in a popup
- 0 hour making the filter work
- 0 hour writing unit tests

To run this project, in terminal:
```
$ npm run build
$ npm run dev
```
